Playing
-------

One to four players connect with XBox controllers.  The left stick moves the
players around.  The right trigger extends the player's shield.

Players take damage by hitting other objects at high speeds or by being hit
by the enemy creatures.  Last player alive wins.  In solo mode, aim for
survival time.

The black areas are holes (don't fall in).  The white areas are walls, and
can be used to bounce off of or slam enemies into.

Todo Items
----------

The following are items that would be nice to do if the desire to continue
hacking on the code takes hold of me.

- Real animations, especially for dying and falling in pits.
- Prettier graphics.
- Proper menus, intro screens, and credits.
- Sound effects and music.
- Little tweaks to gameplay/physics.
- Better and more game arenas.
- Power ups?
- More game modes?
